# California Tenant Protections

## Tenants: Know Your Rights!

## How Much Can My Landlord Charge in Rent?

Depending on whether or not you live in a city that already has a rent control ordinance, or not, allowable rent increases may vary. If your city does **not** already have rent control, but already know you’re protected by the Tenant Protection Act of 2019, our calculator will help you make sure you’re not being overcharged for your rent.
