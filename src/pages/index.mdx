# Learn more about the Tenant Protection Act

The Tenant Protection Act [(Assembly Bill 1482)](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB1482) takes effect January 1, 2020 providing new protections for most California renters.

Under the Tenant Protection Act, eligible renters may be covered in two major ways:

1. Renters may be protected from unjust evictions
2. Renters may be protected against unfair rent increases.

If you live in a city that already has some protections that are better than the new law, and you are eligible for those, your existing protections will still apply. If you didn't previously have protections and your situation is eligibile then you will get the new protections.
