# How old is your home?

The Renter's Protection Act does not apply to buildings that have recieved their certificate of occupancy within the last 15 years.

It can be a bit tricky to find the specific date that this certificate was issued (we're working on how to find out for you automatically), but if people have been living in the building for more than 15 years, you're probably in good shape.

**Could your building get a driver's permit?**
