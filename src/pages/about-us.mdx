# About Us

Tenantprotections.org is a collaborative project between various California non-profits, and volunteers including: Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment (ACCE), Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto (CLESPA), Code for San Francisco / Code For America, and the TechEquity Collaborative.

We’re grateful to the many volunteers who generously donated their time and skills to ensure renters in California have access to reliable information about the Tenant Protection Act of 2019 including: Kyle Peacock, Tom Croucher, Reid Sherman, Linden Chiu, Danica Liang, Kellee Kimbro, Don Spire, and Herman Borrego.

In addition, a special thank you to our volunteers who made the site available in Spanish: Luis Delgado, German Calderon, and Herman Borrego.


# Our Mission

This site exists to provide renters in California with high quality information about their rights under both California law, and local ordinances. We connect renters with local and state-wide non-profits to help them deal with housing issues in their communities.

# More about Our Organizations

## [Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment (ACCE)](https://www.acceaction.org/)
<img src="/logos/acce-logo.png" width="25%" height="25%" />

The Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment (ACCE) Action is a grassroots, member-led, statewide community organization working with more than 15,000 members across California. ACCE is dedicated to raising the voices of everyday Californians, neighborhood by neighborhood, to fight for the policies and programs we need to improve our communities and create a brighter future.

Change from the bottom up: We take seriously our commitment to ground-up organizing to build a strong people’s movement that can create transformative community change. Our local neighborhood chapters and issue committees, led by ACCE Action member leaders, meet regularly to strategize and plan campaigns. Central to this work is the belief that there’s power in numbers and in collective action – ACCE Action members and their allies frequently “take to the streets” with rallies, town halls, and other actions to make their voices heard.

In 2019, ACCE Action worked with a coalition of partners to co-sponsor the Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (AB 1482).
