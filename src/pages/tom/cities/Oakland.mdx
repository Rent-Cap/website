It looks like you live in Oakland in Alameda County.

Since Oakland has rent and eviction protections we want to figure out if you are eligible for those.
If you aren't eligible under Oakland law you may still be covered under Alameda County law.
If neither of those cover you then the state wide protections of AB 1482 may still apply, and we'll help you figure that out too.

Lots of great resources in Oakland
