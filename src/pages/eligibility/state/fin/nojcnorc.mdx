**Unfortunately**, you are not eligible for either just cause eviction protection or rent control.

We think you are ineligible because:
<AppContext.Consumer>
    {({ appCtx }) => (
        <div>
            {
                appCtx.ineligibleType ?
                <p>Some kinds of buildings are ineligible. You answered you rent one of the ineligible types such as an afforable housing unit or a dorm.</p>
                : (!appCtx.app1482Age) ?
                <p>Only buildings which have not been issued a certificate of occupancy in the last 15 years are eligible. Since you indicated your building is newer than 15 years old it is exempt. However it make become eligible in the future once it has had a certificate of occupancy for 15 years.</p>
                : appCtx.sharedKitchenOrBath ?
                <p>You answered that you live with your landlord and share a kitchen or bathroom with them. Landlords who share a kitchen and bathroom in their primary residence with tenants are exempt.</p>
                :
                <p>abc</p>
            }
        </div>
    )}
</AppContext.Consumer>

TODO (tomc) we need something to cover length of rental and explain that you need a minimum vs the building isn't eligible (or when it would become so)
