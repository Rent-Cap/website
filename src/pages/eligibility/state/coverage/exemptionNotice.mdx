# Your Rights

**Unfortunately**, you may not be eligible for either rent control or eviction protection because your landlord is able to claim an exemption. However they must notify you that they are claiming this exemption.

If you have not received the following text in your lease agreement or as a separate letter you may be able get some protection, although we'd strongly suggest reaching out to a tenancy advocacy organization in your situation. Your landlord must have provided you with the following notice:

_“This property is not subject to the rent limits imposed by Section 1947.12 of the Civil Code and is not subject to the just cause requirements of Section 1946.2 of the Civil Code. This property meets the requirements of Sections 1947.12 (d)(5) and 1946.2 (e)(8) of the Civil Code and the owner is not any of the following: (1) a real estate investment trust, as defined by Section 856 of the Internal Revenue Code; (2) a corporation; or (3) a limited liability company in which at least one member is a corporation.”_
