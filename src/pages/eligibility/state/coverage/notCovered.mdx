# Your Rights

**Unfortunately**, we think that you are not covered by the Tenant Protection Act's just cause protection or rent control clauses. You may have other rights, so if you are having issues with your housing situation reach out for help below!

## Why we believe you are ineligible
<AppContext.Consumer>
    {({ appCtx }) => (
        <div>
            {
                appCtx.ineligibleType ?
                <p>You're not covered by the Tenant Protection Act. Some kinds of buildings are ineligible such as government subsidized housing or university dorms, unless you pay with a voucher. You answered that you rent a type of housing which is ineligible, but if you live in subsidized housing, you may have other legal protections against evictions and rent increases. We urge you to seek free legal advice by getting help from a local non-profit below.</p>
                : (!appCtx.builtBefore2005) ?
                <p>Only buildings which have not been issued a "certificate of occupancy" in the last 15 years are eligible. Since you indicated your building is newer than 15 years old, it is <em>likely</em> to be exempt. Your building will become eligible in the future once it has had a certificate of occupancy for 15 years.</p>
                : appCtx.sharedDuplex ?
                <p>If a landlord owns and occupies one unit of a Duplex, then the other unit of the Duplex is not covered by the Tenant Protection Act. You answered that your landlord has lived in one unit of your Duplex since you moved in.</p>
                : appCtx.sharedUnitWithLandlord ?
                <p>Since you share a unit with your landlord, and they don't rent more than 2 units, we think your unit is not covered by the Tenant Protection Act.</p>
                : appCtx.exemptionNotice ?
                <p>You answered that you rent a single family home from an individual landlord. Landlords of single family homes that aren't a corporation, a real estate trust, or an LLC owned by a corporation, are exempt as long as they notify their tenants. You answered that your landlord did notify you that you were exempt.</p>
                :
                <p>Sorry, we have an error and don't have the reason right now.</p>
            }
