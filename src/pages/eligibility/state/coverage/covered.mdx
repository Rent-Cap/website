                <p><strong>Congratulations</strong> we think you are <em>likely</em> to be protected from "unjust" evictions under AB-1482, as long are your building hasn't recieved a "certificate of occupancy" within the last 15 years. Since you didn't know how old your building is we'd recommend connecting with local resources below to find out.</p>

                <p><strong>Unfortunately</strong> you won't get eviction protection until everyone you live with has there for 1 year, or at least one person you live with has been there for 2 years.</p>

                <p>Since you recieve a voucher to support your housing costs you aren't eligible for capped rent under AB-1482. However you are very likely to have other protections on your rent. If you need help reach out below.</p>
