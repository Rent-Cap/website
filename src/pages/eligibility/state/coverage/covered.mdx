                <p>Good news, we think you are <em>likely</em> to be protected from "unjust" evictions under AB-1482, as long are your building hasn't received a "certificate of occupancy" within the last 15 years. Since you didn't know how old your building is we'd recommend connecting with local resources below to find out.</p>
            :
                <p><strong>Unfortunately</strong> you won't get eviction protection until everyone you live with has there for 1 year, or at least one person you live with has been there for 2 years.</p>

            <h2>Limited rent increases</h2>
            {(appCtx.voucher) ?
            <div>
                <p><strong>Congratulations</strong>, you have a Housing Voucher and are protected by the new law. To fully understand these protections, as well as other protections that may be available to you, we recommend you seek legal counsel. If you need additional help, please reach out below.</p>

                <p><strong>Congratulations</strong> your landlord can't legally increase your rent more than a set amount each year based on your current rent and where you live.</p>

If you are in doubt, or worried about your living situation reach out to your local city or county government for support, or a local tenants rights group. We can connect you with them below.</p>
